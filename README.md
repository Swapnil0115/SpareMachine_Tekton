# CI/CD Workflow with Tekton Cluster

## Overview

This workflow demonstrates how to use a **Tekton Cluster** (running on a spare machine) to automate CI/CD tasks triggered from a main desktop. The pipeline pulls, processes it, and pushes the results to GitHub.

     | 2. Pull code from main desktop / repo
     | 3. Run pipeline steps (build, test, dvc push, etc.)
     | 4. Push final code/results to GitHub or remote storage

## ðŸ§© Components Needed
1. Kubernetes on spare machine (e.g., Minikube, kind, or k3s)
2. Tekton Pipelines installed in Kubernetes
3. Git installed and authorized to push to GitHub

---

## Setting up (Tekton)

1. Install Docker and enable Kubernetes in the Spare Machine
2. Install Tekton Pipelines :</br>
   ``kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/latest/release.yaml``
3. Verify using ``kubectl get pods --namespace tekton-pipelines``.
   You should see pods with names like tekton-pipelines-controller and tekton-pipelines-webhook in the Running state.
